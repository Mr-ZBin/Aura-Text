## Guidelines

### Before making Pull Requests

- Make sure you're using the latest version of Aura Text.
- Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
- The new version format should be like this: `vVERSION` , where VERSION should be `n.n.n` or `n.n` (like our existing version codes`

### Use pull-requests only when necessary
- Use pull requests if it is a small contribution, like Typo correction, optimising README, etc.
- Message me on Discord, or Instagram (Links in my Github profile or at bottom of this page) before making a pull request if it's a critical feature or bug fix. That way, we both can make sure we're doing the right thing!

### Shout-outs
- Contributors' names and GitHub IDs will be shouted-out in the README (You can opt-out of this if you want.)

### Sections that are invalid or should be careful of (period.)
- Translations aren't welcomed as of now. Maybe in future!
- Compiling the app to support Linux and macOS. Do this only if you can look after and update those versions whenever new versions for Windows releases.
