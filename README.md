# Aura-Notes
Aura Notes is a Windows based notepad app built with Tkinter and Python by a bored 16 year old boy. It offers a modern look with menu look with dark mode and it is completely open source with no ads or trackers. Infact, it might be the only good looking notepad app made with Tkinter. All the API's are directly from the devs. Since this project is open-source, you can try pyinstaller to get macOS version.
