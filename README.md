## Contributions

You are welcome to make contributions, bug reports and feature requests. A kind message, kindly contact me via Instagram before doing so we can chat more and discuss briefly! My instagram: @jops.niqqa (I post edits lol)

## Known Issues (v1.0.5)

- App freezing while resizing the window
- Scaling issues while using an Ultrawide monitor (the app looks too stretched)
- Unit convertor returns ERROR when trying to convert specific quantities

## To Do 

- Introduce speech typing (ik there's already one made by Windows. Just press Windows + H to activate)
- Switch between light and dark themes
- New Plagiarism checker and remover in the 'Tools' menu
- New and modern icon (i'm using an generic icon rn... Need to change it ASAP)
- Display time and date but in a indistractive and modern way (maybe in a right click menu) (might change it bcz you can just view the time via taskbar.. But what if you're in full-screen mode?)
- Upgrade Math Solver so that it can calculate algebraic expressions, roots, squares, powers etc etc (maybe using Wolframalpha?)

That's it for right now! Will update more To Do's later... Also, i'll mark them as complete if i implemented the feature!

## Footer

That's it for the README. I hope that you'll enjoy using it as much as i enjoyed coding it! Contributions and Feature requests are open right now.
