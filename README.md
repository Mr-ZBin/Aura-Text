## To Do 

- ~~Switch between light and dark themes~~
- New Plagiarism checker and remover in the 'Tools' menu
- ~~New and modern icon (i'm using an generic icon rn... Need to change it ASAP)~~
- Display time and date but in a indistractive and modern way (maybe in a right click menu) (might change it bcz you can just view the time via taskbar.. But what if you're in full-screen mode?)

That's it for right now! Will update more To Do's later... Also, i'll mark them as complete if i implemented the feature!
